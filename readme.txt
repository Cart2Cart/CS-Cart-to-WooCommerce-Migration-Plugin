== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Migration of stores with the same URLs =
After you've provided Source and Target store URLs and performed Demo migration, you can not start new migration with the same store URLs. In Migration Wizard you will receive a notice and will be redirected to the previous migration steps. You will be able to edit current migration settings, or provide new store URLs.

If for some reason you have to perform another migration with the same store URLs after Full migration was completed you have to request for Remigration service. Note that remigration requires clearing all the data that was migrated into your target store during the initial migration. In case you have some new items on your Source store that you want to migrate after Full migration is complete, you can use the option of Recent Data Migration.

= Is it possible to migrate to the same domain on a different directory? =
Yes, it's possible to migrate within same domain using different folders.
You can have your source store in root - www.mystore.com and target store in some subfolder - www.mystore.com/targetstore/

= Does Cart2Cart migrate languages? =
Cart2Cart offers a possibility to map (but not migrate) languages that already exist on your source store with those that will be displayed on a target cart. In order to avoid inconveniences, before migration you have to create proper languages on a target store. To do that you have login to your admin panel, enter language section and create new or edit already existing languages.

= Do you support customized shopping carts? =
Yes, we offer partial cart customization. Our service works directly with databases. Visual and functional store customization doesn’t affect the migration process. Some database extra fields are supported as well. Customized Migration Service is done on customer’s request.

Some database extra fields are supported as well.

You can use DEMO migration to check how your cart customization will be performed. 

= What should I do after Full migration is completed? =
When your store migration is complete, you should check the results of data transfer on your newly established store:

Check your catalog and website data and make sure all the entities has been migrated properly and placed in the appropriate location.
Take care of your SEO and design settings, as this data is not available for migration with Cart2Cart.
Check your store availability. Make sure your domain name is active and your links are working properly.
Test store functionality. Create test product and make test purchase following the standard procedure.
These checks should be done immediately after migration. In case any issues are detected, please contact our Support Team.

After 1-2 days after full migration, ensure that all the links and forms on the website are active. For the next 2-3 weeks, continue website monitoring to be sure that all the data and files were successfully migrated.
